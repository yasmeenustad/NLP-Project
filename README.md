# **:NLP-powered Ham/Spam Message Detection:**
Using advanced methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP), created a strong model that can accurately tell apart spam and ham messages. The dataset has two main parts: one is "Target," which is marked as Ham (1) and Spam (0), and the other is the "Message" part of the text.

### NLP:
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is a part of Computer Science, Human language, and Artificial Intelligence. It is the technology that is used by machines to understand, analyze, manipulate, and interpret human language.

### Spam:
Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk. Often spam is sent via email, but it can also be distributed via text messages, phone calls, or social media.

### Ham:
Ham email refers to an email that is wanted by the recipient and is not considered spam.

Aim of the project is to utilize advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to effectively distinguish between "Ham" messages and "Spam" messages. The core goal is to engineer high-accuracy models for this classification task, thereby elevating communication security and quality through data-driven NLP methodologies.

## Python Libraries Used:
- **Pandas** simplifies data manipulation with versatile structures like DataFrames, essential for tasks from loading to preprocessing in data analysis.

- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** visualization libraries empower users to create insightful plots, enhancing data exploration.

- **Sklearn** provides a comprehensive toolkit for building and evaluating machine learning models.

- **Data Preprocessing:-**
    - Prepare the dataset for analysis by cleaning and organizing the data.
      
- **Data Cleaning:-**
    - Remove irrelevant or noisy data, such as HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation marks.
      
- **Stopword Removal:-**
    - Eliminate common words that do not contribute much to the meaning of the text (e.g., "the," "is," "and").
      
- **Word Stemming:-**
    - Reduce words to their base or root form to remove variations (e.g., "running" to "run," "walked" to "walk").
      
- **Lemmatization:-**
    - Transform words to their canonical form (lemma) to maintain the context and meaning of the words accurately.
      
- **Count vectorization:-**
    - Transforming text documents into numerical representation based on word occurrence frequencies
