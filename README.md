# NLP-powered Ham/Spam Message Detection:
Utilize NLP techniques to create a robust model for distinguishing between spam and ham messages accurately.

### NLP:

NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is a part of Computer Science, Human language, and Artificial Intelligence. It is the technology that is used by machines to understand, analyze, manipulate, and interpret human language.

### Spam:

Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk. Often spam is sent via email, but it can also be distributed via text messages, phone calls, or social media.

### Ham:

Ham email refers to an email that is wanted by the recipient and is not considered spam.

## Python Libraries Used:
- **Pandas** simplifies data manipulation with versatile structures like DataFrames, essential for tasks from loading to preprocessing in data analysis.

- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** visualization libraries empower users to create insightful plots, enhancing data exploration.

- **Sklearn** provides a comprehensive toolkit for building and evaluating machine learning models.

- **Data Preprocessing:-**
    - Prepare the dataset for analysis by cleaning and organizing the data.
      
- **Data Cleaning:-**
    - Remove irrelevant or noisy data, such as HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation marks.
      
- **Stopword Removal:-**
    - Eliminate common words that do not contribute much to the meaning of the text (e.g., "the," "is," "and").
      
- **Word Stemming:-**
    - Reduce words to their base or root form to remove variations (e.g., "running" to "run," "walked" to "walk").
      
- **Lemmatization:-**
    - Transform words to their canonical form (lemma) to maintain the context and meaning of the words accurately.
      
- **Count vectorization:-**
    - Transforming text documents into numerical representation based on word occurrence frequencies

### Models with Accuracy:
1. Logistic Regression Model (98%)
2. Decision Tree Classifier Model (95%)
3. Random Forest Classifier Model (97%)
